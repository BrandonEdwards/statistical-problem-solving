# statistical-problem-solving

Sometimes I'm bad at making decisions, and need some statistics to tell me what I should do with my life. The collection of scripts here serve two purposes:

1. Help me make decisions in my life
2. Allow me to keep sharp with data visualization and data analysis

## Projects

### [Hydro Ottawa Rate](https://github.com/BrandonEdwards/statistical-problem-solving/tree/master/hydro-ottawa-rate)
Should I keep my billing rate on a Time-of-Use structure, where I am billed based on the time of day that I use hydro; or, should I switched to a Tiered structure, where I am billed a rate for the first 1000 kWh, and a higher rate for anything above 1000 kWh?
